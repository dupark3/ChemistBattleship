# PERIODIC TABLE BATTLESHIP VERSION 1.01

## Electron Configuration Basics
If you don't know what an electron configuration is, read the following...
    Each element on the periodic table has an electron configuration "address" associated with it. There are four "sublevels" or areas in the periodic table: s, p, d, and f. There are seven "levels" or rows in the periodic table, 1 through 7. Each element's electron configuration is a coded address, like a url. This address is a combination of every level, sublevel, and sublevel's number of electrons that precede the element's location in the periodic table. For example, Helium is 1s2 since it is in row 1, block s, and there are two electrons in sublevel 1s. Lithium would be 1s2 2s1. The number of electrons is written as a superscript, but that format is ignored for the purposes of this game. 



## RULES:
1. Player must add four 3-block ships, three 4-block ships, and two 2-block ship.
2. Ships must be horizontal or vertical groups of elements that physically touch each other.
2. Player must "shoot" by writing the electron configuration in the following format: 
                
                        Long form: 1s2.2s2.2p6.3s2.3p3
                        Short form: [Ne]3s2.3p3

3. The only exceptions to electron configurations are Chromium ([Ar]4s1.3d5) and Copper ([Ar]4s1.3d10). Assume all others follow Aufbau's principle. 
5. We will assume that the 4f sublevel starts from La to Yb. Lu is in the 5p sublevel.
6. We will assume that the 5f sublevel starts from Ac to No. Lr is in the 6p sublevel.



## GAME FEATURES:
1. Player gains SHORT FORM PRIVILEGE with 3 or more streak of correct electron configuration shots. He/She can then write noble gas configuration in the following shots. However, any misfire will reset the streak and player will lose this privilege until the streak is built back up. 
2. Player gains one X-BOMB for every five consecutive identifications of elements that the opponent is trying to shoot. To use the X-BOMB, player enters "X" instead of a configuration, which activates the bomb. Then the player must enter the center element of the X, and it will explode in an X shape to hit five elements at once.



## FUTURE FEATURES:
1. Allow player to choose to play against computer or against another human player.
2. Provide a periodic table board that keeps track of hits/misses/sinks for the user.
