# PERIODIC TABLE BATTLESHIP VERSION 1.03
Periodic Table Battleship is designed for educational purposes for students studying general chemistry in middle school, high school, or colleges. Students will be asked to WRITE the electron configuration in long and short form and  IDENTIFY elements based on the given electron configuration. The object of the game is to defeat the AI that is firing at the student's ships. The AI uses educated guesses, based on probability of a ship's location and previous hits/misses/sinks. After a few rounds of playing the Periodic Table Battleship, students will be able to quickly write and identify elements using the proper electron configurations. 

## Electron Configuration Basics
If you don't know what an electron configuration is, read the following...
    Each element on the periodic table has an electron configuration "address" associated with it. There are four "sublevels" or areas in the periodic table: s, p, d, and f. There are seven "levels" or rows in the periodic table, 1 through 7. Each element's electron configuration is a coded address, like a url. This address is a combination of every level, sublevel, and sublevel's number of electrons that precede the element's location in the periodic table. For example, Helium is 1s2 since it is in row 1, block s, and there are two electrons in sublevel 1s. Lithium would be 1s2 2s1. The number of electrons is written as a superscript, but that format is ignored for the purposes of this game. There are other nuances, such as the d block's level is its row number minus 1, and the f block's level is its row number minus 2. For more info on how to write electron configurations, watch this [video from Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/electronic-structure-of-atoms/electron-configurations-jay-sal/v/electron-configurations-2).



## RULES:
1. Player must add four 3-block ships, three 4-block ships, and two 2-block ships.
2. Ships must be horizontal or vertical groups of elements that physically touch each other.
2. Player must "shoot" by writing the electron configuration in the following format: 
                
                        Long form                      : 1s2.2s2.2p6.3s2.3p3
                        Short form (when combo reached): [Ne]3s2.3p3 

3. The only exceptions to electron configurations are Chromium ([Ar]4s1.3d5) and Copper ([Ar]4s1.3d10). Assume all others follow Aufbau's principle. 
5. We will assume that the 4f sublevel starts from La to Yb. Lu is in the 5p sublevel.
6. We will assume that the 5f sublevel starts from Ac to No. Lr is in the 6p sublevel.


## GAME FEATURES:
1. Player gains SHORT FORM BONUS with 3 or more streak of correct electron configuration shots. He/She can then write noble gas configuration to make a shot. However, any misfire will reset the streak and player will lose this bonus until the streak is built back up. 
2. Player gains one X-BOMB for every five consecutive identifications of elements that the opponent is trying to shoot. To use the X-BOMB, player enters "X" instead of a configuration, which activates the bomb. Then the player must enter the center element of the X, and it will explode in an X shape to hit up to five elements at once.


## FUTURE FEATURES:
1. Allow player to choose to play against computer or against another human player.
2. Allow player to choose to use the f-block or not (for use at the beginning of learning electron configurations)
